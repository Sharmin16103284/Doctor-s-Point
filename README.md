# Doctor's Point

Netlify Live Site Link : https://doctors-point.netlify.app/

## Description : 
A Doctor Points system consists of all organizations, people, and actions whose primary intent is to promote, restore, or maintain health. This includes efforts to influence determinants of health as well as more direct health-improving activities.
It is therefore more than the pyramid of publicly owned facilities that deliver personal health services.
